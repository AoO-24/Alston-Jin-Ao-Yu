👋 Hello! I'm Jinao Yu, currently pursuing my Master's in Computer Science at Georgia Institute of Technology, focusing on Cloud-Native development, DevOps, MLOps and full-stack development. I got my Bachelor's degree from Univ of Wisconsin-Madison, and have a chance be selected for a fellowship research program at Columbia University. 

I also served as a mentor/organization admin in the [Open Source Promotion Plan (OSPP)](https://summer-ospp.ac.cn/) in 2023, 2024, and in the [Google Summer of Code (GSoC)](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) in 2024.

🎯 What I'm Looking For

With passion in Cloud + Infra + AI, I am actively seeking new graduate or entry-level SDE & DevOps & Infrastructure as Code & SRE positions. I'm also interested in research collaborations in NLP, MLOps Ecosystem, Microservice, Distributed System, Large Language Model.

🌟 **Key Achievements**
- ML Algorithm: Enhanced accuracy of LLMs, BERT, and XGBoost for diverse industrial ML & Infra tasks at Uber, ByteDance.
- ML Infrastructure: Engineered AWS-based solutions to host ML models with robust reliability.
- ML Platform: Built an enterprise-level AI PaaS platform to streamline the model DevOps process at Alibaba.
- ML Systems: Wrote CUDA shaders to accelerate ML inference and image processing algorithms.
- Published 3 research papers in AI and NLP, cited over 40 times.

💡 Research Interests
- MLOps Ecosystem
- Microservice
- Distributed System
- Cloud Native Open Source
- Natural Language Processing
- Large Language Model 
  

- 🚀 **Curiosity:** I know nothing about the world and quite stupid(At least much stupider than AI!), but I’m endlessly fascinated by how things work and how they can be better.
- 🖥 **Interests:** I'm passionate about computer systems, programming languages, and large language models (LLMs). The rise of LLMs is unstoppable. I’m interested in making their inference faster and deployment easier in current operating systems. I’m also exploring how LLMs could change the way we think about operating systems and software.
- 🌟 **Projects:** I’m the creator of the DLUT robotics organization, where I work on eBPF tools and runtimes. I believe that eBPF has the potential to be incredibly powerful, not just on Linux but across all systems. Can we make that a reality? I’m committed to exploring how.
- 📹 **Video:** I regularly share my thoughts and learnings on my vlogs at ...
